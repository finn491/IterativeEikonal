    ================

    Provides methods to compute the orientation score of a 2D image. The primary
    methods are:
      1. `cakewavelet_stack`: compute the stack of cakewavelets, as described in
      Duits "Perceptual Organization in Image Analysis" (2005)
      (https://www.win.tue.nl/~rduits/THESISRDUITS.pdf).
      2. `wavelet_transform`: compute the real wavelet transform of a 2D image,
      with respect to some wavelet (which need not be a cakewavelet).
      3. `wavelet_transform_complex`: compute the complex wavelet transform of a
      2D image, with respect to some wavelet (which need not be a cakewavelet).
      TODO: figure out why `wavelet_transform_complex` does not work...
